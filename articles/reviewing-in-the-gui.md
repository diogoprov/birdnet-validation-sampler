# Reviewing clips in the BirdNET GUI

The manual review of stage 1 happens outside R, in the Review tab of the
BirdNET-Analyzer GUI. This article walks through that review, from the
folder of clips written by
[`cut_clips()`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/reference/cut_clips.md)
to the `Positive` and `Negative` folders that
[`classify_review()`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/reference/classify_review.md)
reads back. The screenshots were taken with GUI version 2.4.0 (model
V2.4) on Windows, on clips of the FrogNet project; the layout may differ
in other versions. The [GUI
documentation](https://birdnet-team.github.io/BirdNET-Analyzer/stable/usage/gui.html)
describes how to install and launch it, and states that the Review tab
implements the workflow of Wood & Kahl (2024).

## The folder of clips

[`extract_validation_clips()`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/reference/extract_validation_clips.md)
(or
[`cut_clips()`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/reference/cut_clips.md))
writes one folder per species under `clips/`, each with the clips to
review. The name of a clip starts with its confidence score and its
rank, followed by the name of the source recording and the start and end
of the clip:

![The clips of one species, ready for
review.](gui-figures/01-clips-folder.png)

The clips of one species, ready for review.

The GUI reads the species from the names of these subfolders.

## Choosing the species

In the Review tab, *Select input directory* points the GUI to the
`clips` folder. The *Species* list then shows one entry per subfolder,
and the counters show the clips still to review (*Todo*) and those
already classified as *Positive* or *Negative*:

![The Review tab with the list of
species.](gui-figures/02-species-list.png)

The Review tab with the list of species.

## Reviewing a clip

Each clip is shown as a spectrogram, with an audio player (with
*Autoplay*, the clip plays as soon as it opens). The name of the clip,
with its score, is shown above the waveform. *Positive* and *Negative*
classify the clip and move to the next one; *Undo* reverses the last
decision and *Skip* moves on without classifying:

![Reviewing a clip. The score of this clip (0.992) is the first field of
its name.](gui-figures/03-reviewing-clip.webp)

Reviewing a clip. The score of this clip (0.992) is the first field of
its name.

Review the clip by listening to it, not only by its score: the score is
what the review is meant to check. For the random designs of
[`vignette("sampling-designs")`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/articles/sampling-designs.md),
the order in which the clips are reviewed does not matter, but every
clip of a drawn occasion must be reviewed (see
[`vignette("crywolf-integration")`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/articles/crywolf-integration.md)).

## The regression panel

Once clips have been classified, the *Regression* panel shows a logistic
regression of the verdicts on the score for the selected species, with
the scores at which the predicted probability of a true detection
reaches 0.85, 0.90, 0.95 and 0.99:

![The Review tab after the review of one species: 72 positive and 7
negative clips, and the fitted curve.](gui-figures/04-regression.png)

The Review tab after the review of one species: 72 positive and 7
negative clips, and the fitted curve.

This curve is a quick check during the review. It is fitted to one
species at a time, pooling every site, on the clips reviewed so far. The
calibration of stage 2
([`calibrate()`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/reference/calibrate.md),
[`vignette("calibration")`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/articles/calibration.md))
fits the species and sites together, lets the curve differ among them,
compares the candidate models by cross-validation and, with
`engine = "brms"`, carries the uncertainty of the curve. Use the GUI
curve to follow the review, and the calibration of stage 2 for the
analyses.

## The result: Positive and Negative folders

The GUI moves each classified clip into a `Positive` or a `Negative`
subfolder of the species folder:

![The species folder after the
review.](gui-figures/05-positive-negative.png)

The species folder after the review.

This is the structure that
[`classify_review()`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/reference/classify_review.md)
and
[`post_validation()`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/reference/post_validation.md)
read. The verdict of each clip comes from the name of the subfolder in
which it is found, matched by the regular expressions `positive_pattern`
(`"positiv"` by default) and `negative_pattern` (`"negativ"`), case
insensitive. A clip left in the species folder, outside `Positive` and
`Negative` (for instance when the review was interrupted), is counted as
`not_reviewed`; a clip of the manifest not found at all, as
`clip_missing`.

``` r

library(sheepdog)
res <- post_validation(review_dir    = "C:/clips",
                       manifest_path = "C:/validation/clip_manifest.csv",
                       output_dir    = "C:/validation/results")
```

## The interface in Portuguese

The GUI can be switched to Portuguese in its settings (the translation
is by Larissa Sugai, according to the GUI documentation). The buttons
become *Positivo*, *Negativo*, *Desfazer* and *Pular*, and the
regression panel, *Regressão*:

![The Review tab in
Portuguese.](gui-figures/06-portuguese-interface.webp)

The Review tab in Portuguese.

![The list of species in
Portuguese.](gui-figures/07-species-list-pt.png)

The list of species in Portuguese.

![Reviewing a clip in
Portuguese.](gui-figures/08-reviewing-clip-pt.webp)

Reviewing a clip in Portuguese.

With the interface in Portuguese, the GUI names the result folders
`positivo` and `negativo` instead of `Positive` and `Negative`. The
default patterns of
[`classify_review()`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/reference/classify_review.md)
(`"positiv"`, `"negativ"`, case insensitive) match both, so the review
can be read back in either language, and clips reviewed partly in each
language end up in the right verdict. The regression panel of a species
with more false positives looks different: here the curve reaches 0.85
only at a score of 0.81, and 0.90 at 0.93, and the higher probabilities
are not reached within the range of scores:

![The regression panel for a species with more false
positives.](gui-figures/09-regression-pt.png)

The regression panel for a species with more false positives.

Species like this are those that
[`cell_status()`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/reference/cell_status.md)
flags as unreliable at `p_min = 0.95` (see
[`vignette("community-matrices")`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/articles/community-matrices.md)).

## Several reviewers

When the clips are split among reviewers, each reviewer reviews their
own copy of the folder tree in the GUI.
[`assign_reviewers()`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/reference/assign_reviewers.md)
splits the clips (with a fraction reviewed twice),
[`split_by_reviewer()`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/reference/split_by_reviewer.md)
copies them, and after the review
[`reviewer_agreement()`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/reference/reviewer_agreement.md)
and
[`consensus_verdicts()`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/reference/consensus_verdicts.md)
measure the agreement and combine the verdicts:

``` r

man <- assign_reviewers(read.csv("C:/validation/clip_manifest.csv"),
                        reviewers = c("ana", "bia", "caio"), overlap = 0.1)
split_by_reviewer(man, clips_dir = "C:/validation/clips",
                  output_dir = "C:/review")

# after each reviewer has reviewed C:/review/<reviewer> in the GUI
reviews <- lapply(c(ana = "ana", bia = "bia", caio = "caio"), function(r)
  classify_review(man, file.path("C:/review", r)))
reviewer_agreement(reviews)
validation <- consensus_verdicts(reviews)
```

Clips with conflicting verdicts get `verdict = "disagreement"` and are
left out of the precision and the calibration until a consensus review
settles them.
