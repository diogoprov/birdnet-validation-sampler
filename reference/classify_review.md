# Classify the reviewed clips

Reads the result of the manual review done in the BirdNET GUI and joins
it to the clip manifest. The GUI organises the review by moving each
clip into subfolders such as `<species>/Positive` and
`<species>/Negative`, so the verdict of each clip comes from the path
where it is found. Clips still in the species folder are not reviewed.

## Usage

``` r
classify_review(
  manifest,
  review_dir,
  positive_pattern = "positiv",
  negative_pattern = "negativ"
)
```

## Arguments

- manifest:

  Clip manifest: a data frame or the path to `clip_manifest.csv`.
  Manifests written by v1.2.0 (`manifesto_clipes.csv`) are also read.

- review_dir:

  Folder with the reviewed clips (the `clips` folder of the validation
  package, after the review).

- positive_pattern, negative_pattern:

  Regular expressions (case-insensitive) that identify the positive and
  negative folders in the path of each clip.

## Value

The manifest with two more columns: `verdict` (`"positive"`,
`"negative"`, `"not_reviewed"` or `"clip_missing"`) and `reviewed_path`,
the path where the clip was found. This is the table written to
`validation_by_clip.csv`.
