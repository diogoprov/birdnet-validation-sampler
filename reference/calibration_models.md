# Candidate calibration models

The family of logistic calibration models compared by
[`compare_calibration_models()`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/reference/compare_calibration_models.md),
from a single logistic regression on the logit of the confidence score
to a binomial GLMM with random slopes by species and a site x species
intercept.

## Usage

``` r
calibration_models(uncorrelated = FALSE, single_species = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- uncorrelated:

  Add `m5_species_x_site_uncorrelated`, the m4 structure without the
  correlation between the species intercepts and slopes. It avoids the
  singular fits of m4 when that correlation is estimated at +-1. `FALSE`
  keeps the candidates of 2.0.0.

- single_species:

  Use a family for one species: global logistic regression, a site
  intercept, and a site intercept and slope. With `uncorrelated = TRUE`,
  also include independent site intercepts and slopes. `FALSE` preserves
  the multispecies family.

## Value

A named list of formulas: `m0_global`, `m1_species_intercept`,
`m2_species_slope`, `m3_plus_site`, `m4_species_x_site` and, with
`uncorrelated = TRUE`, `m5_species_x_site_uncorrelated`. With
`single_species = TRUE`: `m0_global`, `m1_site_intercept`,
`m2_site_slope` and optionally `m3_site_slope_uncorrelated`.

## Details

The list goes from the simplest to the most complex model; that order is
the complexity used by
[`select_calibration_model()`](https://provetelab.org/sheepdog/reference/select_calibration_model.md).
