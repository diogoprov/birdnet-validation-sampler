# Write the community matrices

Reads the nightly detection history written by
[`calibrate()`](https://provetelab.org/birdnet-validation-sampler/reference/calibrate.md)
and writes the matrices of
[`community_matrices()`](https://provetelab.org/birdnet-validation-sampler/reference/community_matrices.md)
to `output_dir`: `frequency_matrix_site_month_k<k>.csv`,
`count_matrix_site_month_k<k>.csv` and `effort_site_month.csv` (which
also lists the dropped cells). This is the function form of the v1.2.0
script `gerar_matrizes_comunidade.R`.

## Usage

``` r
build_community_matrices(
  history_file,
  output_dir,
  core_species,
  k_min = 2,
  min_nights_month = 5
)
```

## Arguments

- history_file:

  Path to `nightly_detection_history.csv` (or a v1.2.0
  `historico_deteccao_noite.csv`).

- output_dir:

  Output folder; created if needed.

- core_species:

  Species codes (the `species` column) that enter the matrix.

- k_min:

  Repetition rule: 1, 2 or 3 reliable detections on the night.

- min_nights_month:

  Site x month cells with fewer recorded nights are dropped from the
  matrices (unstable frequencies) and flagged in `effort`.

## Value

The list returned by
[`community_matrices()`](https://provetelab.org/birdnet-validation-sampler/reference/community_matrices.md),
invisibly.
